## Introduction

This is our project ChadMart

The beginning of this project came from a Hackathon called 10 days project where each teams have 10 days to build a product from a given problem.

This was the given problem

```
Problem Statement

Chulalongkorn University has a digital cash giveaway policy for all students, with each receiving 10,000 Bulbs to stimulate the economy within the country.
In this regard, Chulalongkorn University seeks to support a platform that enables the buying and selling of Bulbs to thrive in the Country. Therefore, we task everyone with creating a product that can promote the exchange of Bulbs between Chulalongkorn students.
```

So we created an E-Commerce product that uses digital money to buy stuff
